## Introduction  
The goal for the non-parametric final project is to develop the model that best predicts survivor rate of the shipwreck from the Titanic. I'll do some initial data cleaning and exploratory analysis to get a better idea of the dataset that we are working with. After, I will train various boosted random forest models to predict survivor rate and optimize for the best prediction score.

##Data  
First, let's see what we are working with:
```{r}
summary(train)

```
So 10 total predictors: 5 categorical and 5 numeric. Moreover, _Age_ and _Cabin_ have missing values, so we will have to find a way to model for those as well. 

Let's take a look at cabin first:
```{r}
table(train$Cabin)
table(is.na(train$Cabin))

```
